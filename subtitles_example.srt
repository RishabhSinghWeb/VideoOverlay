1
00:00:00,275 --> 00:00:00,902
The first subtitle

2
00:00:00,985 --> 00:00:00,997
This is crazy. Second subtitle

3
00:00:01,112 --> 00:00:01,531
Third one

4
00:00:01,614 --> 00:00:01,933
Here is the fourth subtile, it will
be autofitted to the given 
point in the parameters

5
00:00:05,116 --> 00:00:06,326
We can talk, sir.

6
00:00:06,451 --> 00:08:00,205
- Oh, I see. So it's personal?
- No, you intimidate them.

7
00:00:08,288 --> 00:00:09,458
Good God, These are subtitles which 
works directly with the videos.

8
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:16,002
I mean, this is the same format as any other subtitles.

9
00:00:26,127 --> 00:0:28,880
- I thought of you as a soldier first.
- I'm an airman.

10
00:00:28,964 --> 00:00:30,715
You have, actually,
excellent bone structure, there.

11
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,593
I'm kind of having a hard time
not looking at you now.

12
00:01:13,677 --> 00:01:16,471
Is that weird? Come on, it's okay, laugh.

13
00:01:16,846 --> 00:01:19,349
- Sir, I have a question to ask.
- Yes, please.

14
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:23,144
Is it true you went 12 for 12
with last year's Maxim cover models?

15
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,355
That is an excellent question.
Yes and no.

16
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,898
March and I had a scheduling conflict,

17
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:29,901
but fortunately,
the Christmas cover was twins.

18
00:02:29,985 --> 00:02:32,862
Anything else? You're kidding me
with the hand up, right?

19
00:02:32,988 --> 00:02:36,825
- Is it cool if I take a picture with you?
- Yes. It's very cool.

20
00:02:40,412 --> 00:02:41,746
All right.

21
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,957
I don't want to see this
on your MySpace page.

22
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,625
Please, no gang signs.

23
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:47,294
No, throw it up. I'm kidding.

24
00:02:47,377 --> 00:02:50,338
Yeah, peace. I love peace.
I'd be out of a job with peace.

25
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:54,509
Come on. Hurry up. Just click it.
Don't change any settings. Just click it.

26
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:02,183
- What's going on?
- Contact left!

27
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:03,935
What have we got?

28
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:07,272
Jimmy, stay with Stark!

29
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:08,398
- Stay down!
- Yeah.

30
00:03:14,738 --> 00:03:16,281
Son of a bitch!

31
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:20,744
- Wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!
- Stay here!

32
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:51,399
Whoa!

33
00:04:40,824 --> 00:04:42,117
Tony Stark.

34
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:46,037
Visionary. Genius.

35
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:48,790
American patriot.

36
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:49,999
Even from an early age,

37
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,544
the son of legendary
weapons developer Howard Stark

38
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:56,214
quickly stole the spotlight
with his brilliant and unique mind.

39
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:59,718
At age four,
he built his first circuit board.

40
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,970
At age six, his first engine.

41
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:06,474
And at 17, he graduated
summa cum laude from MIT.

42
00:05:07,434 --> 00:05:09,853
Then, the passing of a titan.

43
00:05:11,438 --> 00:05:14,357
Howard Stark's lifelong friend
and ally, Obadiah Stane,

44
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:17,861
steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder,

45
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:21,406
until, at age 21, the prodigal son returns

46
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:24,868
and is anointed the new CEO
of Stark industries.

47
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:26,286
With the keys to the kingdom,

48
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:29,164
Tony ushers in a new era
for his father's legacy,

49
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:33,293
creating smarter weapons,
advanced robotics, satellite targeting.

50
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:37,255
Today, Tony Stark has changed
the face of the weapons industry

51
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:40,133
by ensuring freedom
and protecting America

52
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:42,761
and her interests around the globe.

53
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:53,438
As liaison to Stark Industries,

54
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:57,776
I've had the unique privilege
of serving with a real patriot.

55
00:05:57,942 --> 00:06:01,613
He is my friend
and he is my great mentor.

56
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:04,324
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor

57
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:08,703
to present this year's Apogee Award
to Mr. Tony Stark.

58
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,253
Tony?

59
00:06:29,516 --> 00:06:32,143
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Thanks for the save.

60
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:35,897
This is beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.

61
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,398
This is wonderful.

62
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:41,319
Well, I'm not Tony Stark.

63
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:48,326
But if I were Tony,
I would tell you how honored I feel

64
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,373
and what a joy it is
to receive this very prestigious award.

65
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:55,250
Tony, you know...

66
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:59,254
The best thing about Tony
is also the worst thing.

67
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:00,713
He's always working.

68
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:06,219
Work it! Come on!

69
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:13,351
- We should just stay till the morning.
- You are unbelievable.

70
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:16,688
- Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?
- Nobody roped me into anything!

71
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:17,856
- I'm so sorry.
- But they told me that

72
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:20,692
if I presented you with an award,
you'd be deeply honored.

73
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:22,694
Of course I'd be deeply honored.
And it's you, that's great.

74
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:24,529
- So when do we do it?
- It's right here.

75
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:26,781
- Here you go.
- There it is. That was easy.

76
00:07:26,865 --> 00:07:28,199
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, it's okay.

77
00:07:28,283 --> 00:07:30,618
Wow! Would you look at that?
That's something else.

78
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:32,287
I don't have any of those
floating around.

79
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,455
We're gonna let it ride!

80
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,625
Give me a hand, will you?
Give me a little something-something.

81
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,877
Okay, you, too.

82
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,795
- I don't blow on a man's dice.
- Come on, honey bear.

83
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,464
There it is.
Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...

84
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:44,799
Two craps. Line away.

85
00:07:44,883 --> 00:07:46,634
- That's what happens.
- Worse things have happened.

86
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,136
I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, will you?

87
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:49,721
- This is where I exit.
- All right.

88
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:50,847
Tomorrow, don't be late.

89
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:52,098
- Yeah, you can count on it.
- I'm serious!

90
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:53,474
I know, I know.

91
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,145
Render unto Caesar
that which is Caesar's. There you go.

92
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:03,818
Mr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark!

93
00:08:04,152 --> 00:08:06,362
